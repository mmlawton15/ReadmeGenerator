# Professional README Generator Starter Code
[How to create a Professional README](./readme-guide.md)

## What is this project?
This project is a readme generator for developers to use. They answer a few command-line prompts, and at the end have a professional readme generated for them! The beauty of this is that if you're in a time crunch or don't want to manually build one, this tool can do the leg work.

## How did I build it?
I built this project using Javascript, Inquirer and Node.js. This is how I prompt the user for information and build out the Readme file.

## What did I learn during this project?
This was my first project where I familiarized myself with Inquirer, and I haven't coded the same since. It's a very useful tool and I am glad I got to see all the functionality it provides first-hand.

## Where can i see an example?
You can see an example of this readme on my Github Repo (https://github.com/mmlawton15/readme-generator-butterscotch) or at the actual sample readme located at Develop/README.md.
